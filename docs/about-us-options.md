                    We get it. You've tried everything. The $200 serums that didn't work.
                    The 10-step routines you couldn't keep up with. The products that promised
                    miracles but left your skin worse than before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we started Aura Clara. As women who've been through it all—hormonal
                    breakouts, stress acne, sleepless nights with newborns, the works—we knew there
                    had to be a better way. Products that actually work. Routines you can actually
                    maintain. Results you can actually see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every product we create is tested on our own skin first. If we wouldn't use it,
                    we won't sell it. It's that simple. Because your skin deserves better than empty
                    promises and marketing hype.

                    Aura Clara wasn't born in a lab or a boardroom. It started in our bathrooms,
                    staring at our reflections, wishing skincare could be simpler, more honest,
                    and actually effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As women navigating careers, relationships, hormones, and everything in between,
                    we know your skin tells your story. The late nights. The stress. The triumphs.
                    The exhaustion. We created Aura Clara because we believe you deserve skincare
                    that supports you through it all—not adds to your mental load.

## Option 3: Intimate & Vulnerable

                <p class="story-highlight">
                    Picture this: It's 2 AM. You're scrolling through your phone, face breaking out
                    again, cart full of products you're not sure will work, wondering why skincare
                    has to be so complicated, so expensive, and so...disappointing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That was us. Three women in our late twenties and early thirties, tired of being
                    sold miracle cures by brands that clearly didn't understand what we were going through.
                    The hormonal acne. The pregnancy skin changes. The stress breakouts before big presentations.
                    The exhaustion that shows on your face when you're juggling everything.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We started Aura Clara in a tiny apartment, testing formulas on our own skin,
                    staying up late researching ingredients, and asking ourselves one question with
                    every decision: <strong>"Would this actually help my best friend?"</strong>

                        products that work so you can get back to living yours."
                    </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Today, Aura Clara serves over 50,000 women who are just as tired of the beauty
                    industry's BS as we were. Every product launch, every formula tweak, every decision
                    is made by women who use these products themselves.
                </p>

                <p class="story-closing">
                    Because at the end of the day, we're not just building a brand.
                    <strong>We're building the skincare line we wish we'd had all along.</strong>
