## Video Hero vs Static Image: The Data

### Static Images WIN for Conversion

**Key Findings:**
- Video backgrounds contribute to LOWER conversion rates in most A/B tests
- Conversion experts (Tim Ash/SiteTuners, Peep Laja/ConversionXL) found video/sliders lost sales across thousands of tests
- Static images dominate in: speed, mobile responsiveness, SEO, conversion clarity

**When Video Fails:**
- Too distracting for clear conversion path
- Reduces CTA visibility
- Hurts user decision-making
- Slower load times (critical on mobile)
- Complex offers need words, not video distraction

**When Video Could Work:**
- Very simple value propositions
- Entertainment/lifestyle brands (not conversion-focused ecommerce)
- Desktop-heavy traffic (not mobile-first)
- Brand awareness campaigns (not product sales)

**Test Results:**
- Static high-resolution image improved LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) by 1.1 seconds while maintaining similar conversion rates
- Slimmed-down hero with static image: 25-55% conversion increase

### Recommendation for Aura Clara:
**Use static lifestyle imagery for hero section.** Save video for:
- Secondary sections (how-to-use, below the fold)
- Social media content (Instagram Reels, TikTok)
- Email marketing
- Product detail pages (not homepage hero)

## Mobile vs Desktop Hero Considerations

### Mobile-First Design Principles

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Separate mobile hero image** - desktop image scaled down often illegible
2. **Flexible layouts** - split-screen designs that adapt (Ana Luisa example)
3. **Larger touch targets** - CTA buttons sized for thumbs (minimum 44x44px)
4. **Minimal text** - 3-5 words maximum in hero headline for mobile
5. **Fast load times** - <3 seconds critical (compress images aggressively)

**Mobile-Specific Optimizations:**
- Vertical-oriented imagery (not horizontal crops)
- Single column layouts (not side-by-side)
- Larger font sizes (16px+ for body, 32px+ for headlines)
- Contrasting CTA buttons (thumb-sized, high contrast)
- Reduce animation/video (bandwidth + performance)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test on actual devices (iPhone, Android)
- 3G/4G connection simulation (not just WiFi)
- Various screen sizes (iPhone SE to Pro Max, Android variants)
- Portrait AND landscape orientations

### Desktop Enhancements
- Split-screen hero (image + text side-by-side)
- More detailed copy possible
- Hover effects on CTAs
- Larger product imagery showcase
- Multi-image carousels (use sparingly, not in main hero)

## Specific Recommendations for Aura Clara (Premium Pimple Patch Brand)

### Recommended Hero Section Strategy

**Primary Approach: Lifestyle Transformation Hero**

**Visual Elements:**
- **Main Image:** Young person (Gen Z/Millennial) applying or wearing Aura Clara patches in natural bathroom/bedroom setting
- **Lighting:** Soft, natural light (morning routine vibe)
- **Mood:** Confident, calm, self-care moment (not clinical/medical)
- **Product Visibility:** Patches clearly visible but not dominating (on skin or in hand)

**Copy Elements:**
- **Headline (5-7 words):** "Clear Skin Confidence. Overnight."
- **Subheadline (10-15 words):** "Premium hydrocolloid patches that work while you sleep. Gentle, effective, invisible."
- **CTA:** "Shop Patches" or "Get Clear Skin" (not "Buy Now")

**Design Specifications:**
- **Mobile:** Vertical hero image, headline + CTA only, <3 second load

### Alternative Approach: Bold Product Hero (Starface Model)

**If going for playful/Gen Z positioning:**
