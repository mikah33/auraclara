**Example Messaging:**

- Countdown timers (visual urgency)

**Seasonal Campaigns:**
- "Summer Clear Skin Bundle"
- Holiday gift sets

**First-Time Buyer Offers:**

- "Buy 3 patch packs, get sculpting guide free"
- "Mystery gift with every order this weekend"

❌ False "only 2 left" on unlimited inventory
❌ Constant "flash sales" (devalues brand)
