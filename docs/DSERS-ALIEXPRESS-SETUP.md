#### **Product Mapping Guide:**

|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Clarity Patches (36ct)** | "hydrocolloid acne patches 36" | Look for 4.5+ stars, 1000+ orders |

| **Jawline Shaper** | "gua sha face roller set" | Choose jade/rose quartz |
| **V-Line Mask** | "V shape face lift mask" | Look for compression fabric |
| **Bio-Collagen Mask** | "collagen face mask hydrating" | 4-pack or bulk options |

#### **How to Import Products:**

1. **Find Product on AliExpress**
   - Open AliExpress.com
   - Search for your product (e.g., "hydrocolloid acne patches")

2. **Use DSers Chrome Extension** (Recommended)
   - Install: https://chrome.google.com/webstore (search "DSers")
   - When on AliExpress product page, click DSers extension icon
   - Click "Import to DSers"

3. **OR Copy Product URL**
   - Copy AliExpress product URL
   - In DSers: Go to "Import List"
   - Click "Add Product URL"
   - Paste URL → Import

4. **Edit Product Before Pushing to Shopify**
   - In DSers Import List, click "Edit"
   - Change title to match your branding (e.g., "Aura Clara Clarity Patches")
   - Upload YOUR product images (the ones from your site)
   - Set YOUR price (markup 2-3x AliExpress price)
   - Add your product description
   - Select correct variant (36-count, etc.)

5. **Push to Shopify**
   - Click "Push to Shopify"
   - Product syncs to your Shopify store
   - **Map it to your existing Shopify products** (important!)

---

### Step 5: Map AliExpress Products to Your Existing Shopify Products

**CRITICAL STEP:** You already have products on Shopify. Don't create duplicates!

1. **In DSers Dashboard**
   - Go to "Linked Products"
   - Find your Shopify product (e.g., "Clarity Patches")

2. **Click "Link Supplier"**
   - Search for the AliExpress product you imported
   - Click "Link"
   - Now when someone orders "Clarity Patches" on Shopify, DSers knows to order from AliExpress

3. **Set Variants Mapping**
   - If you have different sizes/colors, map each variant
   - Example: "36-count" → AliExpress "36 pieces" option

---

### Step 6: Configure Order Settings

1. **In DSers → Settings → Orders**

2. **Enable "Auto Order"** (Optional but recommended)
   - When customer orders on Shopify → DSers auto-orders from AliExpress
   - **WARNING:** This uses your PayPal/Credit card automatically
   - Turn OFF if you want manual control

3. **Set Supplier Rules**
   - Choose suppliers with ePacket shipping (7-15 days)
   - Prioritize US warehouses for faster shipping
   - Set backup suppliers in case stock runs out

4. **Configure Shipping Methods**
   - Select "AliExpress Standard Shipping" or "ePacket"
   - Avoid "China Post" (too slow, 30-60 days)
   - If supplier has US warehouse, SELECT IT (2-5 day shipping)

---

### Step 7: Order Fulfillment Process (When Customer Orders)

#### **Automatic Flow:**

```
Customer Orders on Shopify
         ↓
Order Appears in DSers "Awaiting Order"
         ↓
DSers Auto-Orders from AliExpress (if auto-order enabled)
         ↓
AliExpress Supplier Ships to Customer
         ↓
DSers Auto-Updates Tracking to Shopify
         ↓
Customer Gets Tracking Email
```

#### **Manual Process (if auto-order disabled):**

1. **New Order Notification**
   - You get Shopify order notification
   - Order appears in DSers "Awaiting Order" tab

2. **Review Order in DSers**
   - Click on order
   - Verify: Product, Quantity, Customer Address

3. **Place Order on AliExpress**
   - Click "Order Now" in DSers
   - DSers redirects you to AliExpress cart
   - **Use customer's REAL shipping address** (DSers auto-fills)
   - Pay with your PayPal/Credit Card
   - Complete AliExpress checkout

4. **Update Tracking**
   - DSers automatically syncs tracking number to Shopify
   - Customer gets email with tracking info
   - Mark as "Fulfilled" in Shopify

---

### Step 8: Pricing Strategy

**Formula for Profit:**

```
Your Shopify Price = (AliExpress Cost + Shipping) × 2.5 to 3

Example:
- AliExpress: $5.00
- Shipping: $2.00
- Your Cost: $7.00
- Your Price: $7.00 × 3 = $21.00
- Profit per sale: $14.00
```

**Your Current Prices (Good markups!):**
- Clarity Patches: $12.99 (AliExpress ~$3-4)
- Face Sculpting Tool: $52.99 (AliExpress ~$15-20)
- Jawline Shaper: $12.99 (AliExpress ~$2-3)

---

### Step 9: Quality Control (CRITICAL!)

**Before Launching:**

1. **Order 1-2 Samples of Each Product**
   - Order from AliExpress to YOUR address
   - Test quality, shipping time, packaging
   - Take your own product photos

2. **Check Supplier Reliability**
   - Minimum 4.5 stars rating
   - At least 95% positive feedback
   - 1000+ orders processed
   - Check reviews for US customers (faster shipping)

3. **Test Shipping Times**
   - How long did your sample take?
   - Set realistic expectations on your site
   - Add 2-3 days buffer for processing

4. **Look for US/EU Warehouses**
   - Much faster shipping (2-7 days vs 15-30 days)
   - Higher cost but better customer experience
   - Filter AliExpress by "Ships From: United States"

---

### Step 10: Customer Service Setup

**Common Questions You'll Get:**

1. **"Where's my order?"**
   - Check DSers tracking
   - If no tracking after 3 days, contact supplier
   - Offer partial refund if over 30 days

2. **"Product defective/wrong item"**
   - Ask for photos
   - Contact AliExpress supplier via "Contact Seller"
   - Offer refund or replacement
   - Don't make customer return to China (too expensive)

3. **"Shipping too slow"**
   - Apologize and offer 10-15% refund
   - Explain it's coming from overseas
   - Upgrade to express shipping next time

**Pro Tip:** Add this to your Shipping Policy:
```
"Processing Time: 2-3 business days
Shipping Time: 7-15 business days (US Standard)
Express Shipping: 3-7 business days (+$10)"
```

---

### Step 11: Advanced Tips

#### **Use Multiple Suppliers**
- Don't rely on 1 supplier (stock issues)
- In DSers, add 2-3 backup suppliers per product
- DSers auto-switches if primary is out of stock

#### **Negotiate with Suppliers**
- Once you hit 50+ orders/month, message suppliers
- Ask for bulk discounts or faster shipping
- Some suppliers offer private labeling (your branding)

#### **Custom Packaging (Optional)**
- Ask supplier to remove AliExpress invoices
- Some suppliers offer custom packaging ($0.20-0.50 per item)
- Makes unboxing experience better

#### **Track Profit in DSers**
- DSers shows profit per product
- Monitor which products are winners
- Drop losers, double down on winners
